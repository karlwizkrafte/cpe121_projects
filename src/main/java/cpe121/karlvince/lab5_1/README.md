# Zoo Management System - Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Separated Classes into Individual Files
- **Animal.java**: Abstract base class for all animals
- **Lion.java**: Lion implementation with red-colored "ROAR!" sound
- **Tiger.java**: Tiger implementation with yellow-colored "GROWL!" sound  
- **Elephant.java**: Elephant implementation with blue-colored "TRUMPET!" sound
- **Monkey.java**: Monkey implementation with green-colored "OOH OOH AH AH!" sound
- **Zoo.java**: Zoo management class with colored output for add/remove operations
- **Menu.java**: Enhanced menu system with colored prompts and formatting
- **REYES_LE_5_1.java**: Main application class with improved UI

### 2. KVX Library Integration
Added the following KVX library features:

#### From kvx.cli.Std:
- `clear()`: Clears the terminal at application start
- `format()`: ANSI color formatting for text output
- `print()`: Enhanced print functionality  
- `newl()`: New line with optional count parameter

#### From kvx.cli.Util:
- `drawLine()`: Draws decorative separator lines

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- **Color-coded animals**: Each animal type has its own color when talking
- **Colored prompts**: Different colors for different types of user input
- **Enhanced formatting**: Better visual separation with decorative lines
- **Improved error messages**: Color-coded error and success messages
- **Better section headers**: Bold and colored section titles

### 4. File Structure
```
src/main/java/cpe121/karlvince/lab5_1/
├── Animal.java          (Abstract base class)
├── Elephant.java        (Blue elephant)
├── Lion.java           (Red lion)
├── Menu.java           (Enhanced menu system)
├── Monkey.java         (Green monkey)
├── REYES_LE_5_1.java   (Main application)
├── Tiger.java          (Yellow tiger)
└── Zoo.java            (Zoo management)
```

### 5. Benefits of the Refactoring
- **Better maintainability**: Each class is in its own file
- **Enhanced user experience**: Colorful, interactive interface
- **Improved code organization**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Reusable components**: KVX library utilities for consistent formatting
- **Better error handling**: Visual feedback for user actions

### 6. Running the Application
```bash
# Compile the project
mvn clean compile

# Run the application
java -cp target\classes cpe121.karlvince.lab5_1.REYES_LE_5_1
```

### 7. Features Demonstrated
- Object-oriented programming with inheritance
- Abstract classes and method overriding
- Enhanced user interface with the KVX library
- Color-coded output for better user experience
- Proper error handling and validation
- Menu-driven application design
